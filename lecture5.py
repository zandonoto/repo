# Number to base 2
# Because we have a limited numbers of bits that can be stored in our computer system (32 or 64 bits), we need to represente the numbers in a binary format.
# Thats why we need to use that kind of method to get approximiation of the number we want to represent, so it doesnt fail to represent the number we need to find.
# The following code will convert a number to its binary representation.

# num = -10

# Inicializa a vari√°vel result
# result = ''

# if num < 0:
#     is_neg = True
#     num = abs(num)
# else:
#     is_neg = False

# if num == 0:
#     result = '0'

# while num > 0:
#     result = str(num % 2) + result
#     num = num // 2 

# if is_neg:
#     result = '-' + result

# print(result)


# x = float(input('Enter a decimal number between 0 and 1: '))

# p = 0
# while ((2**p)*x)%1 != 0:
#     print(f'Remainder = {str((2**p)*x - int((2**p)*x))}')
#     p += 1

# num = int(x*(2**p))

# result = ''
# if num == 0:
#     result = '0'
# while num > 0:
#     result = str(num%2) + result
#     num = num//2

# for i in range(p - len(result)):
#     result = '0' + result

# result = result[0:-p] + '.' + result[-p:]
# print(f'The binary representation of the decimal {str(x)} is {str(result)}')
